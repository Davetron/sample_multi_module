# sample_multi_module

This is a sample application structured for encapsulated builds using [Conveyor](https://github.com/Davetron/conveyor).  
There's a pipeline module which contains the [definition/implementation](https://github.com/Davetron/sample_multi_module/blob/main/pipeline/src/main/java/co/databeast/pipeline/Pipeline.java)  of the build.  
A pipeline [script](https://github.com/Davetron/sample_multi_module/blob/main/pipeline.sh) at the root of the project executes the build.
